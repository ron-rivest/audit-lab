"""
Prototype code for auditing an election having both multiple contests and
multiple paper ballot collections (e.g. multiple jurisdictions).
Possibly relevant to Colorado state-wide post-election audits in Nov 2017.

Some documentation for this code can be found here:
    https://github.com/ron-rivest/2017-bayes-audit.git
    in the 2017-code README.md

This code corresponds to the what Audit Central needs to do, although
it could also be run locally in a county.

class Election(object):

    """
    All relevant attributes of an election and an audit are stored within 
    an Election object.

    For compatibility with json, an Election object should be viewed as 
    the root of a tree of dicts, where all keys are strings, and the leaves are
    strings or numbers, or lists of strings or numbers.

    In comments: 
       dicts: an object of type "cids->int" is a dict mapping cids to ints,
                and an object of type "cids->pcbids->selids->int" is a nested 
                set of dicts, the top level keyed by a cid, and so on.
       lists: an object of type [bids] is a list of ballot ids.

    Glossary:

        cid    a contest id (e.g. "Den-Mayor")

        gid    a contest group id (e.g. "FEDERAL")

        pbcid  a paper-ballot collection id (e.g. "Den-P24")

        bid    a ballot id (e.g. "Den-12-234")
               This should be unique within a pbc.

        selid  a selection id (e.g. "Yes" or "JohnSmith"). A string.
               If it begins with a "+", it denotes a write-in (e.g. "+BobJones")
               If it begins with a "-", it denotes an error (e.g. "-Invalid" or
               "-NoSuchContest" or "-noCVR").  Errors for overvotes and undervotes
               are indicated in another way.  Each selid naively corresponds to
               one bubble filled in on an optical scan ballot.  If a ballot doesn't
               contain a contest, its reported vote (from the scanner) and its
               actual vote (from the audit) will be (-NoSuchContest).  (See the
               next paragraph about votes.)

        vote   a tuple of selids, e.g. ("AliceJones", "BobSmith", "+LizardPeople").
               An empty vote (e.g. () ) is an undervote (for plurality).
               A vote with more than one selid is an overvote (for plurality).
               The order may matter; for preferential voting a vote of the form
               ("AliceJones", "BobSmith", "+LizardPeople") indicates that Alice
               is the voter's first choice, Bob the second, etc.               



    It is recommended (but not required) that ids not contain anything but
             A-Z   a-z   0-9  -   _   .   +
    and perhaps whitespace.

        # *** Notation

        # We use nested dictionaries extensively.
        # variables may be named e.de_xyz
        # where x, y, z give argument type
        # (and there may be one or more of these):

        # rn = reported number (from initial scan)
        # sn = sample number (from given sample stage)
